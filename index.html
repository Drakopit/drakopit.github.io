                        I worked as a <strong>DevOps Engineer</strong>, handling the full spectrum of tasks required
                        in the role, including developing, maintaining, and optimizing workflows and infrastructure.
                        As a contractor, I contributed to projects for notable companies such as <strong>Icatu Seguros,
                            Globo, MedGrupo,</strong> and <strong>SuperGásBrás,</strong> among others.

                        I developed applications across desktop, web, and mobile platforms, including creating pages
                        and components for a custom <strong>CRM</strong> at <strong>Global Tecnologia</strong>. My work
                        involved utilizing advanced technologies and techniques such as <strong>lazy loading, MVVM architecture,
                        observables, Gulp,</strong> and <strong>Webpack</strong>. I also created reusable components
                        and implemented <strong>IndexedDB</strong> to temporarily store user information, enhancing
                        performance and user experience.
